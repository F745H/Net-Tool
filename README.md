Net tool has lot of functions that needed for average computer user for day to day work.
1) Ping:-

The ping command sends packets of data to a specific IP address on a network and then lets you know how long it took to transmit that data and get a response. It’s a handy tool that you can use to quickly test various devices of your network.

2) Traceroute:-

A traceroute provides a map of how data on the internet travels from its source to its destination.  When you connect with a website, the data you get must travel across multiple devices and networks along the way, particularly routers. It helps to understand where actual problem is while communicating.

3) Restart Network Devices:-

Restarting your network devices is the first troubleshooting step when you encounter a networking issue. This function restarts the physical network interface devices like Ethernet & Wi-Fi.

4) Resolve Network Problems:-

If restarting devices does not solve the networking issue. We have to clear & renew DNS cache, Winsock and sometime reset the resetlog file. This all will done in one Resolve button click.

5) Boost System Speed:-

After using systems for several times some caches, temporary files, prefetch files and recent files gets created in different locations which slow downs computer speed. Before this we used to delete those files one by one which is too time consuming. By this function we can delete all those files in just one click. 

# Install
Nothing extra things needed. Just open the software that's it.

# Note
You should open this software as an administrator to work properly. This software has some functions that needs administrator privileges i.e. to restart network devices, to delete temporary files & prefetch files etc.
